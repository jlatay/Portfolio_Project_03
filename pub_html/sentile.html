          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            The health issue our team targeted and addressed are the difficulties visual impaired individuals face when navigating through all the traffic they come across. The opportunity we are that are taking advantage of is the current lack of navigational innovation that can physically direct the disabled in an unintrusive and safe way. We have created <strong>Sentile - a Social Enterprise</strong> that provides ease of navigation through tactile installments to assist and empower disabled individuals to lead an independent life with a simple step at a time.

          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            For this project, my team and I had the objective of addressing the lack of physical directional navigation initiatives. We have conceptually created the idea of servicing a product to help people with visual impairment. Our product involves the use of tactile pavement and has two overarching features. The first being that the tactile paving designs will have basic shapes to ensure current brail initiatives are consistent. The second being that tiles will also have pulsing signal lights along the edge of the pavements to signify the final terminal point of a bus stop. In the long-term, funding is outside the scope of this project, as a wide range of implementation needs to be done on public properties.
          </p>
          <h3 class="project-paragraph-captions">Physical Prototype</h3>

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            As previously mentioned, our serviced product has two overarching features. The tactile paving designs would include strips of lines that signifies the motion of moving forward as well as a circular brail that indicates the action of knowing where to stop. There are lights along the edge of the pavements. The colour of the lights are intended to be magenta which are said to be colour blind friendly and high in colour contrast instead of being reflective. These lights will also have the feature of a pulsing effect to prevent distractions of passing traffict as well as to help distinguish the meaning of the tiles.

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            Our target users are people with the disability of blindness, more specfically those with limited vision in British Columbia. The reason we are targeting people with visual impairment is that due to the fact in reference to Statistics Canada, 127, 090 people with the disability of vision are at the age of 15 or older in British Columbia. Having said that, report shows that 16.8% of people with blindness are actually not able to reach a bus stop.

            Our implementation plan consists of a few components:
          </p>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            <strong>First is our survey</strong>, which we will be conducting to identify which local areas to promote a pilot project with our solution.
          </p>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            <Strong>Second is our user testing marketing</strong>, in which we will raise awareness of for this initiative and further get input from our audience for product improvements.
          </p>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            <strong>Lastly is with legal approval</strong>, the implementation for our interactively lighted tactile pavements, installation and replacement of the current tiles will be executed.

          <!--CHALLENGES-->
          <h2 class="project-subheaders">Challenges</h2>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            With this business proposal and specific topic regarding health and a disability scope, my team and I faced many challenges. We only had a week before each deliverable. Having said that, we also had different schedules making it difficult to ideate and align ideas together. On that note, I found myself taking on the role as a project leader. I was primarily in charge of organizing our group meetings, as well as offer any help to anyone who was struggling to get their part of the project done. Although I found it very challenging, at the same time it very rewarding. It was one of the very few times where I found my voice and felt confident leading a team of people coming from different programs and faculties.
          </p>

          <!--FINAL THOUGHTS-->
          <h2 class="project-subheaders">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            Having worked with students not originally from my program was interesting in the sense that people's strengths and weaknesses really showed. One person would be great with statistics and reasoning. Another person was great at making pitches, as we all had to pitch our idea to twelve judges. With this project I was very happy to experience and engage with user interactions, as we had the tasks of observing people, interviewing them, and creating an empathy map that listed their pain points. Having done all of this really brought out the ideas for our project, as we have gained several insights that support our research and ideas in relation to the proposal of Sentile. On that note, what I haved learned was how to work with individuals with different disciplinary backgrounds. This will help me in the future, as it has prepared me to work with different people coming from different industries.
