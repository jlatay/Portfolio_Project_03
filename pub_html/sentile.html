          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            The health issue our team targetted and addressed are the difficulties visual impaired individual's face when navigating through all the traffic they come across. The opportunity we are that are taking advantage of is the current lack of navigational innovation that can physically direct the disabled in an unintrusive and safe way. Which is why we have created Sentile - a Social Enterprise that provides ease of navigation through tactile installments to assist and empower disabled individuals to lead an independent life with a simple step at a time.

            For this project, my team and I had the objective of addressing the lack of physical directional navigation initiatives. We have conceptually created the idea of servicing a product to help people with visual impairment. Our product involves the use of tactile pavement and has two overarching features. The first being that the tactile paving designs will have basic shapes to ensure current brail initiatives are consistent. The second being that tiles will also have pulsing signal lights along the edge of the pavements to signify the final terminal point of a bus stop. In the long-term, funding is outside the scope of this project, as a wide range of implementation needs to be done on public properties.

          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            As previously mentioned, our serviced product has two overarching features. The tactile paving designs would include strips of lines that signifies the motion of moving forward as well as a circular brail that indicates the action of knowing where to stop. There are lights along the edge of the pavements. The colour of the lights are intended to be magenta which are said to be colour blind friendly and high in colour contrast instead of being reflective. These lights will also have the feature of a pulsing effect to prevent distractions of passing traffict as well as to help distinguish the meaning of the tiles.

          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            Our target users are people with the disability of blindness, more specfically those with limited vision in British Columbia. The reason we are targeting people with visual impairment is that due to the fact in reference to Statistics Canada, 127, 090 people with the disability of vision are at the age of 15 or older in British Columbia. Having said that, report shows that 16.8% of people with blindness are actually not able to reach a bus stop.

            After having created this mobile application and getting to work with android studios for the first time, I feel like our project was received really well by our professor and peers. Many who have actually tried our application, have said that it would be really useful to have when travelling alone at night, and that the location when the emergency message is sent super accurate. Hearing these comments really changed my perspective on how projects should be approach as well as how decisions could be made, and because of that I was able to learn more about user experience. The only changes I would have made if given more time is the addition of more graphics, but overall I was very happy with how the project turned out, as it is something even I would use myself.

          <h2 class="project-subheaders">Challenges</h2>
          <p class="projects-paragraph">
            One of the challenges my partner and I faced involved the debugging of code in android studios, which can become quite tedious if the code is not properly structured and consistent. Other challenges involved ideating on the look of the user interface as we wanted to the app to look subtle yet simple. Part of this decision was due to the fact that, we did not want to make the app bright and saturated as it is sort of a safety precaution tool. One last challenge worth noting was figuring out how our target user would flow and navigate through the application. This took quite a fair bit of time as we had to strategically think about what were the most significant tasks the user could potentially carry out.
